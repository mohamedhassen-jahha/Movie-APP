# MOVIE APP PROJECT

This is my first React project this big so far.

## Objective:

In this checkpoint, we are going to create a movie app where you can present your favorite movies or TV shows. We will also be able to use the react hooks.

### Instructions:

Create the following components:

- MovieCard
- MovieList
- Filter ( title, rate)

Every movie should have the following attributes: title, posterURL, rating
The user should be:

- Able to add a new movie.
- Filter the movies with title/rating.

### API

I didn't implement an API in this project as it's not required. Nonetheless, i use IMDbÂ® API through Postman to get real data and so the implementation of an API later won't take too much work.
